Privacy Quest is a project made for the purpose of letting users use unfiltered encrypted private chat among each other in AQW. Privacy Quest provides many features in game such as change username/guild color for yourself and others who use the program, secret chat (encrypted chat that anyone in the room using the program can see), emotes in the secret chat, house blacklist to kick unwanted players from your house, and more. Everything is real time, all players on the program can see colors, links, and any changes the program makes.

Do !!help to see all commands available.

To change username/guild colors for yourself and others, type !!colors in chat. Guild colors only change if your guild mates are also using the program. When secret chat is enabled, only users on the program and in the same room can see it. Moderators cannot view the chat in a report, and the chat is encrypted.

All chat restrictions have been removed, you can send profanity, links, and previously unsendable symbols in the chat such as "@", "&" and any brackets.
