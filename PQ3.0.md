# Temp Drop Inventory

Temp Drop Inventory lets you preview drops before you decide to accept them & includes info about sellback price, description, AC tag, member-only and so on.
By default, regular drops are hidden now. To re-enable them, activate the Classic Item Drops in F3 menu.

# Automatically deselect your character.
![autodeselect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miyah-chan/PrivacyQuest/main/media/autodeselect.gif)

Deselects your character when a skill that targets it is used. You can still click yourself.

# Enhancements made easy
![autoenh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miyah-chan/PrivacyQuest/main/media/autoenh.gif)

You can now enchant by specifying either all, or explicitly items between class, weapon, cape and helm then adding the enhancement between luck, wiz, thief and fighter.
